"""Quantize the PDF-pipeline ONNX models to INT8 for faster CPU inference.

Two quantizations, both validated against the PDF corpus (see
docs/PDF_CONFORMANCE.md for the measured speed/quality numbers):

* **layout** — static QDQ INT8 of the RT-DETR layout model, **Conv ops only**
  (the HGNetv2 backbone). Calibrated on real corpus pages rendered exactly the
  way `layout.rs::predict` preprocesses them. The transformer decoder and
  detection heads stay fp32: quantizing their MatMuls shifts class scores near
  the 0.3 threshold and visibly degrades output (headers demoted to text,
  page-footers leaking in), while conv-only keeps groundtruth conformance at
  fp32 level. ~2.4x faster layout inference on AVX-512-VNNI CPUs, 172 -> 68 MB.
  Weights are 7-bit (`reduce_range`), which costs nothing here and keeps the
  model correct on CPUs *without* VNNI — see `check_weight_range`. BatchNorm
  is folded into the conv weights first (`fold_conv_affine`; the quantizer's
  Q/DQ pairs otherwise block ONNX Runtime's runtime fusion and the backbone's
  110 normalizations run as fp32 passes — ~40% of int8 layout time), the two
  stem convs stay fp32 (`stem_convs`), and activation ranges come from a
  per-page moving average (`CalibMovingAverage`).

* **tableformer-encoder-fp16** — the TableFormer encoder with its weights
  stored as fp16 and cast back to fp32 at load (`encoder_fp16.onnx`, #374).
  Compute stays fp32, so this is a *size* lever (~103 → ~52 MiB after the
  export's zero attention masks are stripped), not a speed one; the only
  numeric change is fp16 rounding of the weights. Self-validates against the
  fp32 encoder on the calibration pages (cross-K/V and enc_out cosine ≥
  0.9999, relative L2 error ≤ 0.5 %) and deletes its output on failure; the real
  gate is the PDF snapshot corpus (`scripts/conformance/pdf_conformance.sh`
  with `DOCLING_TABLEFORMER_ENCODER` pointed at it).
* **tableformer-decoder** — dynamic INT8 (weights-only MatMul) of the
  legacy autoregressive tag decoder (~10% faster than its fp32 file,
  78 -> 50 MB). Byte-exactness is quantizer-environment-sensitive:
  redp5110's TOC decode has near-tie tokens that a re-quantization can
  flip (the currently shipped asset is corpus-exact; a fresh one drifted
  that single fixture) — always re-gate pdf_conformance.sh after
  re-quantizing and keep the previously validated asset if it drifts.
  Since #97 the Rust loop prefers the byte-exact fp32 decoder_kv over
  this file anyway, so it only serves setups without the KV export.

* **code-formula-decoder** — dynamic INT8 of the CodeFormulaV2 KV-cache
  decoder step (the enrichment VLM; needs the --enrich models). Not in the
  default target list because the fp32 export is opt-in too. ~655 -> ~165 MB
  (4x less decoder RAM). NEAR-exact, not byte-exact: greedy decoding has
  occasional near-tie tokens the weight rounding can flip - on the
  conformance fixture the only drift is one extra blank line inside the
  code block (per-channel and fp32-lm_head variants flip it identically,
  so per-tensor is kept for the smaller file). DOCLING_RS_FP32=1 restores
  the byte-exact fp32 decoder.

Usage (from the repo root, models fetched by scripts/install/download_dependencies.sh):

    uv venv .venv-quant && uv pip install --python .venv-quant/bin/python \
        onnx onnxruntime sympy pypdfium2 pillow numpy
    .venv-quant/bin/python scripts/install/quantize_models.py layout tableformer-decoder

Then point the pipeline at the quantized files:

    export DOCLING_LAYOUT_ONNX=$PWD/.models/layout_heron_int8.onnx
    export DOCLING_TABLEFORMER_DECODER=$PWD/.models/tableformer/decoder_int8.onnx

Re-run scripts/conformance/pdf_conformance.sh (or diff Markdown against
tests/data/pdf/groundtruth) after re-quantizing to re-verify quality.
