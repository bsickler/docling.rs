//! Content-based page-orientation detection for the OCR path (#225).
//!
//! `/Rotate` normalization (see `pdfium_backend::extract_page`) only helps
//! when the rotation is *declared*: a phone photo taken sideways or a sheet
//! fed into the scanner in landscape has `/Rotate 0` and looks upright to the
//! PDF layer, so layout and OCR run on a sideways/upside-down raster and
//! recognize noise — silently. This module detects the raster's own
//! orientation and reports the angle to un-rotate by, composing with the
//! metadata normalization through the same [`PdfPage::unrotate`] machinery.
//!
//! There is no orientation model to run (the pipeline deliberately has no
//! text-*detection* network — layout is the detector, and it is exactly what
//! fails on a sideways page). Instead the recognizer itself is the judge, the
//! classic OSD trick: segment the page into line crops (the pure-Rust
//! projection segmentation OCR already uses), recognize a handful of the
//! widest lines under each orientation hypothesis, and score each hypothesis
//! by how much confident text falls out. Upright text decodes many characters
//! at high confidence; sideways/upside-down text decodes few, badly. An
//! upright page early-exits after scoring only its own hypothesis, so the
//! common case pays a few small recognition runs; the probe count is capped,
//! so cost does not grow with page density.
//!
//! Scores are deterministic (single-threaded recognition, fixed probe
//! selection), so pinned snapshots stay stable. Failures degrade to "assume
//! upright" — detection must never make a conversion worse than not having
//! run at all. `DOCLING_RS_OCR_ORIENTATION=off` disables the pass;
//! `DOCLING_RS_DEBUG=1` prints per-hypothesis scores.
//!
