# PDF conformance

How close the Rust PDF pipeline gets to docling's **default** Markdown, measured
byte-for-byte against the committed groundtruth (`tests/data/pdf/groundtruth/*.md`).
The groundtruth is regenerated from **live published docling**. The numbers in
this document are measured with `scripts/conformance/pdf_groundtruth.sh`,
which pins the conformance model set (fp32 layout/OCR env overrides below);
`scripts/conformance/conformance.sh pdf` runs the *default* (int8, English-OCR)
models over every source PDF, so its totals differ from this table.

> Measure locally with `scripts/conformance/pdf_groundtruth.sh` (diffs the checked-in
> reference; no docling install needed) or `scripts/conformance/conformance.sh pdf` (installs
> docling and diffs against it). Both report two metrics: **strict** (byte-for-byte)
> and **whitespace-normalized** (spacing-only diffs ignored). Diff = changed lines
> vs the groundtruth (one changed line counts as 2).

## Current state

**9 / 17 strict** · **10 / 17 whitespace-normalized.** (The two Korean
image-only pages `skipped_1page`/`skipped_2pages` carry no text groundtruth and
are no longer scored.)

| 2206.01062 | 56 | author-block cluster splits (model-borderline) + one int8-borderline header rowspan; 4 of the lines are the #424 same-row author order, which docling 2.127 produces too — the committed groundtruth is an older docling's |
| right_to_left_03 | 58 | RTL bidi + wrapper (form) children order |
| redp5110_sampled | 70 | TOC row structure tails + cover-page ordering |

Measured on the current tree with `scripts/conformance/pdf_groundtruth.sh`.
The earlier revision of this table predated docling 2.118's reading-order
dehyphenation (docling#3888, ported in #250) — both sides now join a
hard-hyphenated lowercase continuation across a column/page break without the
`word- continuation` artifact — and the groundtruth refresh below.

### docling-core 2.96 table headers: PDF baselines refreshed

The table-header rule ported in #362 (docling-core#723/#756 — the header block
is the leading rows on which a `column_header` cell *starts*, flattened per
column with ` - `) changed the Markdown of every multi-row-header table, the
PDF pipeline's included. The declarative corpora were regenerated with it; the
PDF snapshots and the docling groundtruth were not, because neither runs in CI
(both need pdfium + the models). Five snapshots and four groundtruth files
therefore read as "drift" that was really a stale baseline:

* `2206.01062`, `2305.03393v1`, `2305.03393v1-pg9`, `2203.01017v2` and the
  rendered `text_document_02.odt` — every drifting line was a table line;
* re-serializing **docling's own committed JSON** (`tests/data/pdf/groundtruth/*.json`)
  with docling-core 2.96 reproduces our new tables exactly, and changes those
  four groundtruth files and no others (the remaining ten re-render
  byte-identical, which is also what makes this refresh auditable: the
  committed `.md` really is the serialization of the committed `.json`);
* the groundtruth refresh is not quite table-only — it carries every
  docling-core change since that groundtruth was taken, which here means six
  further lines: a picture's **non-caption** text children (`HTML`, `OTSL`,
  `PDF Cells`, in `2305.03393v1` and `2203.01017v2`) are no longer serialized,
  while its caption still is. Our pipeline never emitted those fragments, so
  that part moves toward us as well;
* so the groundtruth `.md` was refreshed from that JSON rather than from a new
  docling run — the document model did not change, only its serializer — and
  the snapshots were regenerated.

A later pass (#382) took `2206.01062` from 113 to 82: docling#4216's header
flags let `header_row_count` drop the pivot-table deviation this port carried,
so a table whose first row is a lone spanning label now promotes that row to
the header exactly as docling does. Its snapshot was regenerated with it.

Both baselines improve as a result: the snapshot corpus is back to 97/97 exact,
`2305.03393v1-pg9` is byte-exact against the groundtruth again, and the three
remaining table-heavy fixtures drop from 203 → 113 (`2206.01062`), 48 → 20
(`2305.03393v1`) and 65 → 55 (`2203.01017v2`) diff lines.

### docling 2.118–2.123 assembly / post-processing parity (#321)

Upstream refined several PDF post-processing rules between 2.118 and 2.123;
all of them are ported, each as a deterministic snapshot update:

| upstream | rule | where it lives here |
|---|---|---|
| docling#3888 (2.118) | reading-order merge: a hard hyphen before a lowercase continuation is a split word — join without the hyphen | `assemble::merge_continuations` (ported earlier, #250) |
| docling#4052 (2.122) | line join: a line-final dash fuses the wrapped word only when *attached* to it (the character before it is alphanumeric); a detached dash — a separator, a bullet, the bare `-` cell an ORCID superscript splits off — is kept and the lines join with a space (`[0000 - 0002 - 3723`, previously `[0000 -0002 -3723`) | `assemble::cells_text` (the `sanitize_text` port) |
| docling#4059 (2.122) | cross-type coincident pairs: a region the layout model proposes under two labels at a near-identical box (IoU > 0.8) with confidences within 0.1 keeps the richer label — `document_index` over `table`, a table-like over `picture`, a surviving structured element over a `form`/`key_value_region` container. The earlier port dropped every coincident picture regardless of confidence | `assemble::handle_cross_type_overlaps` |
| docling 2.127 `_init_l2r_map` (#424) | same-row links in the reading-order graph: two elements consecutive in the postprocessor's assembly order (source-cell order, docling's `cid`), the left strictly left of the right and sharing a row (vertical IoU > 0.8), are linked left→right — the link is an up/down edge, and a vertical edge onto the left partner is redirected to the row's right-most element, so a row is read through before the paragraph below it | `reading_order::init_l2r` / `init_ud`, `assemble::cluster_cids` |
| docling#4064 (2.123) | `form` / `key_value_region` are containers: everything > 80 % inside (text, list items, and now tables and pictures) is a child, reading-ordered among itself and emitted as one block where the container sits in the page order; the container shrinks to its children's union for that ordering | `assemble::order_with_containers` |
| docling#3906 (2.118.1) | a picture ≥ 80 % inside a TableFormer table is nested in the cell covering it (grid position inferred from median row/column centers when cell boxes overlap): the cell's Markdown reads `text  <!-- image -->` like docling's `RichTableCell`, the JSON `table_cells`/`grid` keep the plain text, DocLang gets the blocks (`Table::cell_blocks`), and the picture is no longer a standalone figure | `assemble::match_table_pictures` |
| docling#4061 (2.122) | forced full-page OCR (`--force-full-page-ocr`, `ocr_mode=full_page|layout_regions`) skips the text-layer decode outright — the cells were cleared unread; on vector-dense pages the decode was most of the page cost | `pdfium_backend::for_each_page(extract_text = false)` |
| docling#4008 (2.121) | digital pages with `/Rotate`: pdfium's text rects, the pure-Rust parser's glyphs and link annotation rects live in the unrotated frame while the page size and render are display-frame — every rect is now rotated into the display frame, so layout regions and cells line up again (a `/Rotate 90` copy of `base14_fonts.pdf` used to lose its heading to orphan text; it now yields docling's exact Markdown and matching geometry) | `pdfium_backend::to_display_frame` |

Snapshot fallout of this batch (all reviewed against docling 2.124 output):
the detached-dash joins (2203, 2206, 2305, redp5110, the METS/GBS book), the
`right_to_left_03` form pages — whose key/value table now survives next to
its form container (upstream keeps that table too; the older baseline had the
form win the shared wrapper bucket and dissolve it into paragraphs) — and the
container-grouped ordering on the QR-bill scan. The three rotated-scan
baselines (`ocr_test_rotated_*`, `nemotron_multipage`) had been stale since
July: they predate the `/Rotate` normalization and still carried the sideways
OCR garbage; regenerated, they read the upright text like the groundtruth.

Deliberate deviations: a picture inside a table that *pairs with a caption*
stays a standalone figure (upstream nests it and the caption is lost); the
form/key-value grouping affects ordering only — the children are emitted as
top-level items, not wrapped in a `form_area` / `key_value_area` group node,
so the JSON has no such group (the Markdown is identical either way).

`amt` is the 7th under the whitespace-normalized metric: its only diff is
docling's spurious double space before the `1⁄4` fraction, where our single-spaced
output is the more faithful rendering. The remaining non-exact PDFs are heavy
multi-column / table docs whose gaps are model-level (TableFormer structure,
layout classification, title-page reading order), not text-layer.

The heavy table docs improved with the docling-parse **word-cell** grouping
feeding TableFormer and the #61 layout/reading-order postprocessor
(2305.03393v1 93→30, 2203.01017v2 209→161, 2206.01062 198→92): the parser's
per-word cells reproduced docling-parse's `word_cells` closely enough that
cell-to-grid matching tracked docling much better (the word grouping was later
replaced wholesale by the `create_word_cells` port described below). See
"Text reconstruction" below. The #60 matching work (docling's `MatchingPostProcessor` ported to
`tf_match.rs`, plus docling's exact table-crop rounding chain) took
2203 157→150 and redp5110 204→202 with every other fixture unchanged; the
#62 text fixes (docling-parse's quote-normalization table — every curly
quote → `'` — and joining region cells in docling-parse index order
instead of geometric bands) then took 2203 →130, 2206 92→80, 2305 28→26,
normal_4pages 56→44, redp5110 →194, and table_mislabeled 88→86.

The #157 **text-panel recovery** deliberately trades a few diff lines for
recovered content: an *uncaptioned* `picture` that is really a text panel —
dense, wide, multi-line words, whether from the digital text layer or from
OCR of the crop (docling's `bitmap_area_threshold`: bitmap areas ≥ 5 % of
the page get OCR'd on every page kind) — is demoted into per-paragraph text
regions instead of shipping as pixels. docling drops that text entirely
(cells assigned to a picture cluster are never serialized), so the +2/+6/+2
on 2203/normal_4pages/redp5110 are real recovered words (e.g.
normal_4pages' cover publisher block), not regressions; captioned figures
(the corpus' document screenshots) and sparse-label charts keep their crops
and their byte-exact output — `picture_classification` stays **exact**.

The #165 orphan-claimer fix mirrors docling's regular/special cluster split:
only regular clusters claim cells (`_find_unassigned_cells` walks
`regular_clusters` alone), so a line that merely *straddles* a figure border
no longer loses its cells to the picture's 0.2 claim — it becomes an orphan
text region and is emitted, as docling does. Orphans that end up fully inside
a picture or table are still re-dropped, matching docling's Markdown (a
picture's children never reach `MarkdownPictureSerializer` output; a table's
text renders through the grid). Took 2206 80→76 and table_mislabeled 86→80
with every other fixture byte-identical.

The #200 fix closes the scanned-page gap in that same rule: on OCR'd pages
the speculative in-picture OCR (the pass that feeds text-panel demotion)
emitted *all* of its recognized lines beside a kept picture, so a chart's
axis-tick strings spliced into the body text right next to the image — where
docling's postprocess "Remove regular clusters that are included in wrappers"
walks `SPECIAL_TYPES` (picture included) and silently absorbs any orphan
> 80 % contained in the picture as its child. The same containment drop that
already handled the first orphan wave now re-runs after the in-picture wave,
so only border-straddlers (≤ 80 % containment) surface as text, on scanned
pages exactly as on digital ones. The digital corpus is untouched (6/14
strict, same per-file diffs); 17 scanned/image snapshots shed their leaked
figure-internal text (axis ticks, diagram labels — net −59 lines).

The #419 **cell refit** closes a gap that sat *before* the reading order.
docling's `LayoutPostprocessor` never hands the model's boxes to the
reading-order predictor: once cells are assigned, every regular cluster's
bbox becomes the union of its cells (`_adjust_cluster_bboxes`), a regular
cluster left with no cells is dropped (`keep_empty_clusters=False`, formulas
excepted), and a cluster > 0.8 contained in another is merged into it
(`_remove_overlapping_clusters`, three rounds). The port assigned cells and
made orphans but ordered the raw model boxes. That mattered whenever a box
ended partway through a line: the line missed the 0.2 claim and became an
orphan (fine), but the *next* paragraph's model box still overlapped that
line by a few points, so the strictly-above graph had no edge between them
and emitted the paragraph first — the orphan came out stranded after the
paragraph it belonged in, and `predict_merges` had already spliced the
paragraph across the gap (a 460-page book showed 1540 of 6050 text blocks
starting mid-sentence). `assemble::fit_regions_to_cells` is the refit —
regular boxes fitted to their cells, empty regular boxes dropped, orphans
inside a fitted box folded in — run once the page's cells are final, before
TableFormer and the reading order; cell assignment is unchanged, since a
fitted box contains every cell it claimed. Groundtruth moved only toward
docling: 2206 82→52 (its author block now reads exactly as docling's),
2305 20→18, normal_4pages 20→16, everything else identical; snapshots
changed on 2206/2305/normal_4pages and on four fixtures with no groundtruth
(llncsdoc's theorem-environment lines rejoin their paragraphs, nextn's
figure digits sit beside their subscript bases, old_newspaper and qr_bill
reorder a few OCR blocks). The same refresh took in the four blank-line
drifts #385 had left in the PDF baselines (its list-boundary rule reached
the PDF serializer, and the snapshots were not re-run then).

The #424 **same-row links** port a reading-order rule that the predictor had
kept disabled for years and docling switched on when it moved the model in
house (docling#4093, 2.124): `_init_l2r_map` pairs two elements that are
*consecutive in assembly order* — the postprocessor's `_sort_clusters(mode=
"id")`, i.e. source-cell order, which docling numbers as `cid` — when the
first is strictly left of the second and the two share a row (vertical IoU
> 0.8). The pair is an up/down edge of its own, and a vertical edge whose
upper end has a right partner is redirected along the row to its right-most
element, so a row is read through before anything below it. The trigger
was a Pearson copyright page: the LCCN sits right of the Dewey number on one
line, the layout model gave it no box, and the orphan it became had no
horizontal neighbour below it without an interruption in between — a head of
its own, emitted after the copyright paragraph, and spliced into the middle
of it by `predict_merges`. `assemble::cluster_cids` computes the assembly
ranks and `reading_order::init_l2r` / `init_ud` carry the rule; container
children get it among themselves. The rank is the region's first source
cell, then top edge, then left edge — and for a table, picture or container
the first cell *inside* it: upstream every unclaimed cell is an orphan
cluster, and the ones > 0.8 inside a table become its children, so a table
sorts where its interior text sits in the stream. Without that, tables sort
last, two side-by-side tables become consecutive and row-linked, and the
right table's caption is read ahead of the left column's headings (2206
page 8) — which docling does not do. Verified against docling 2.127 itself:
on `2206.01062` page 1 its author row reads Pfitzmann, Auer, Dolfi on one
line, exactly as ours now does (the committed groundtruth predates the rule
— its last real docling run was June 2026 — hence the 2206 diff moves 52→56
against it, all in that author row); on the reported Pearson page it reads
the LCCN right after the Dewey number. Every other groundtruth fixture is
unchanged, 9/17 strict as before. Snapshots refreshed for 2206 and for four
fixtures without groundtruth — three LaTeX figure PDFs whose diagram labels
now read row-wise (`swa`, `fp8-128accumulatorv4`, `overlap`) and
`old_newspaper`, whose OCR columns reorder two blocks.

The #265 **table-caption attachment** ports the table arm of docling's
`ReadingOrderPredictor._find_to_captions`: a `caption` region binds to the
table (or `document_index`) **immediately adjacent to it in reading order** —
above-caption and below-caption both, but only when exactly one side holds a
table/picture/code element, and never across intervening text. Adjacency, not
geometry, is the load-bearing choice: a flush-left `Table N:` label pairs with
a centered grid it doesn't horizontally overlap, while a geometrically-nearby
caption in the other column of a two-column page never pairs across the
gutter (a distance-based draft did exactly that mispairing on 2203's page 7).
The paired caption is consumed from its own reading-order slot and rides on
the table node — Markdown prints it above the grid, JSON emits docling's
`TableItem.captions` `$ref`, DocLang its `<caption>`. Caption text is now
also markdown-escaped on all three arms (table/picture/code), matching
docling's `export_to_markdown` post-process — redp5110's `TAX\_ID` and
2203's `&lt; td &gt;` figure caption were silently unescaped before. Took
2203 80→66 and redp5110 75→73, nothing worse; picture pairing (below-caption,
h-overlap-gated) is untouched.

The **cell order & join** are now docling's own, end to end. Serialization
order is pure docling-parse index (`_sort_cells`) — the geometric line
re-sort it replaces measured strictly worse on the corpus: normal_4pages'
big section numerals paint *after* their heading text, so only index order
yields docling's `## 들어가며 1`. The join is `PageAssembleModel.sanitize_text`
ported verbatim: a space after every line except one ending in `-`, which
fuses a wrapped word (alnum on both sides — the dash is dropped) or glues
verbatim when the dash stands alone — 2305's superscript ORCIDs render as
docling's `[0000 -0002 -3723 -6960]`, and its OTSL list keeps the raw en-dash
bullet in the text (`- -"C" cell a new table cell …`; the assembler no longer
strips a leading dash, only the symbol-font bullets docling-parse itself
drops). On top of that, cell assignment is exclusive (`_assign_cells_to_clusters`):
each non-empty cell goes to the single best-overlapping regular region at
> 0.2 intersection-over-self, so a cell under two overlapping boxes emits
once ("Hours Hours" duplicates gone), the orphan pass claims at the same
threshold (the old > 0.5 mirror and its (0.2, 0.5] completeness hole are
structurally closed), and normal_4pages' cover publisher block now lands in
its furniture cluster exactly as docling files it. Together: 2305 24→14,
normal_4pages 44→32, 2203 84→80, 2206 92→90, redp5110 166→164,
table_mislabeled 76→72 — −48 lines, nothing worse.

**Word cells are docling-parse's own `create_word_cells`** — a second
contraction over the shared char cells under the word factors
(`word_space_width_factor_for_merge` 0.33 for the adjacency gate, 2 × 0.33
for the never-firing space threshold), with space glyphs acting as pure
word-boundary barriers dropped from the run up front. The words TableFormer
matches against therefore tokenize exactly as docling's: a thin CJK space
whose neighbors overlap contracts into one spaceless word (docling's
`1군감염병`, where splitting at every line-space manufactured `1군 감염병`),
while a full Latin space's gap exceeds the gate and keeps words apart.
Table-heavy fixtures moved wholesale: redp5110 164→73 (the TOC "OTSL
model-level blocker" was largely tokenization), table_mislabeled 72→54,
normal_4pages 32→20, everything else byte-identical.

**Tables inside pictures serialize now.** 2203's Figure 10 is a *screenshot*
of a table: layout detects a `table` cluster inside the `picture`, TableFormer
reads its grid — but the region had no text layer, its speculative in-picture
OCR lines were discarded on digital pages, and the empty-text gate dropped the
whole element. docling OCRs bitmap-covered areas on every page kind and its
table cluster collects those cells. Mirroring the scanned path for exactly
these tables (text-less, >50 % under a picture, on a digital page): the table
region's word crops are recognized and feed the TableFormer matcher and the
cell set, so the grid serializes with text. The recovered ANOVA grid matches
docling's structure cell-for-cell; the cell *strings* differ where both
engines read noise (PP-OCR vs EasyOCR), which costs 2203 +6 diff lines —
a deliberate completeness-over-metric trade (an ODF presentation fixture's
table screenshot also gains its grid). The remaining 2206 table diff is a
single top-left header rowspan the int8 TableFormer resolves as two cells
where docling's fp32 run predicts one 2-row span — span decoding itself is
exercised by neighboring tables; that one token is quantization-borderline.

**TeX math glyphs decode by their built-in encodings.** The standard TeX
math fonts (`CMSY*`, `CMMI*`) ship no PDF `/Encoding`, no ToUnicode, and a
CFF program this parser does not read — their codes fell through to
StandardEncoding and rendered as the wrong ASCII: 2203's `{ahn,…}` author
line read `f ahn,… g`, `→` read `!`, `∈` read `2`, `|T|` read `jTj`.
A static table of the fixed TeX layouts (TeXbook Appendix F), keyed off the
base font name and applied only when the font dict has no `/Encoding` at
all, restores docling-parse's decode (it reads the same mapping out of the
font program). Took 2203 86→74. Cross-page **paragraph continuations** also
align with docling's `predict_merges`: the head test now accepts a trailing
comma (`.+[a-z,\-\u00AD]`, ASCII-lowercase only — a lone `μ` or an
uppercase OCR fragment no longer stitches), and tables joined the skip
set (docling's skip-labels), so 2206's "…In phase four," resumes across a
caption+table+figure page break. Took 2206 90→82; the remaining author-block
chain differences trace to model-borderline cluster splits (docling's run
splits a name block ours detects whole), not the merge rules.

The **footnote-hyperlink** port (docling's `PageAssembleModel._match_hyperlink`:
the URI whose annotation rects cover ≥ 0.5 of the region box, accumulated per
URI, pydantic-`AnyUrl` trailing-slash normalization) renders 2206's footnote
URLs as docling's `[1 https://…](https://…)` whole-item links. Scope is
footnote-labeled regions only: upstream's assemble stage matches every text
label, but both committed groundtruth generations observably carry the
hyperlink into the document **only for footnote items** (2206 page 1's fully
covered plain-text DOI line has `hyperlink: null` in docling's own JSON while
the equally covered footnotes keep theirs), and the corpus is the reference.
Took 2206 76→72.

**Code blocks flattened in legacy** (docling parity): docling's parser has no
line-preserving code path — its code items carry the lines joined by single
spaces — so `text` now holds that flat form on every byte-conformance surface
(legacy Markdown, JSON, DocLang, chunks) and the line-preserving extraction
moved to the new `pretty` field, which **strict** Markdown prefers. Took
code_and_formula 5→**exact** and redp5110 196→172 (its SQL listings); the
strict output is unchanged.

A **word-completeness audit** (character-level diff of normalized output vs
groundtruth, reorderings filtered out) confirms the extraction itself is
whole: 10 / 14 fixtures lose *zero* groundtruth words; the remaining gaps are
table-cell structure (2203's ANOVA grid, redp5110's authority-matrix rows —
TableFormer), picture-child divergence (2305's HTML/OTSL figure axis labels),
RTL/checkbox forms (right_to_left_03), and docling-parse artifacts we
deliberately don't reproduce (`/tildelow`, `/.notdef` glyph-name leaks).

The audit exposed one systematic hole, closed at the time by raising the
orphan claim to mirror the then-> 0.5 serializer (and later closed
*structurally* by the exclusive > 0.2 assignment above): docling assigns each
cell to its best cluster at > 0.2 overlap and serializes the assigned cells,
while our serializer took cells at > 0.5 — a cell whose best overlap fell in
(0.2, 0.5] was "claimed" but emitted by nobody (right_to_left_03's standalone
`20300`, several Korean labels on the skipped_1/2page scans). The orphan
pass's claim test now mirrors the serializer's criterion, so **every
non-empty text cell either serializes inside a region or becomes an orphan**
— completeness by construction. Checkbox regions
(`checkbox_selected`/`unselected`) are also no longer skipped: they assemble
as docling's task-list items (`- [x] بلی`). right_to_left_03's remaining diff
is ordering, not content — docling wraps that page's fields in `form`
containers whose children serialize in docling-parse cell order, while we
emit the same items in geometric reading order; the full wrapper-children
port (and the bidi run order of `-2-5`-style headings) stays on the
model-level blocker list, together with the title-page cluster splits of
2305/2206 (residual heron score noise — see the docling-exact layout input
below).

The **docling-exact layout input** closed most of the preprocessing gap: the
layout model now runs on the same image docling's stage feeds it — a
dedicated `get_page_image(scale=1.0)` render (pdfium at 1.5×, sized with
pypdfium2's `ceil`, then PIL-BICUBIC down to point size) stretched to
640×640 with **PIL BILINEAR**, both kernels ported byte-exactly from
Pillow's fixed-point `Resample.c` (`resample.rs::pil_resize`, verified
against genuine Pillow reference hashes; `preprocessor_config.json` says
`do_pad: false` — the heron processor stretches, it does not letterbox).
Previously the model saw a Triangle stretch of the 2× OCR bitmap —
resampling 1224→640 and 612→640 are different regimes, and heron's
borderline scores follow the pixels. Riding along: docling's same-label
**picture dedup** (`_remove_overlapping_clusters`, IoU/containment > 0.8
groups, larger box wins within 0.3 confidence), which collapses a figure
detected both whole and as sub-panels into the whole-figure box (2206's
four-thumbnail Figure 1). Net −48 diff lines corpus-wide: 2203 132→84,
normal_4pages 50→44, redp5110 172→166, table_mislabeled 80→76, 2305 26→24,
rtl_03 62→60; 2206 went 72→92 — its author-block clusters shifted at the
model's noise floor (ort-vs-torch fp32 numerics) and the reading-order
merge chains land differently. Every exact fixture stayed exact. The
browser (canvas) and METS/TIFF paths keep the legacy stretch (no pdfium
renderer there); the int8 default graph was calibrated on the old input
distribution — the fp32 low-coverage guard absorbs the borderline pages,
and the quant can be recalibrated with `scripts/install/quantize_models.py`
at the next model release.

## DocLang (`.dclx`) conformance

Separate from the Markdown metric above: how close `--to dclx` gets to docling's
DocLang archive, scored on the extracted `document.xml` against the committed
groundtruth (`tests/data/pdf/groundtruth_dclx/*.dclx`, from published docling
2.112.0). Run `scripts/conformance/dclx_conformance.sh pdf`; sweep the tolerance
with `scripts/conformance/dclx_pdf_tol_sweep.sh`.

**PDF avg similarity: 52 % exact · 63 % at the default ±2-grid-unit tolerance**
(issue #32 target: ≥50 %). The ±2 figure is within a point of the
*geometry-ignored* ceiling (65 %), so essentially all of the coordinate
difference is absorbed by ±2 — a wider tolerance buys almost nothing.

### What the geometry tolerance is, and why it is honest

Every laid-out block in a DocLang archive carries four `<location>` provenance
tokens — its bbox as `round(512·coord/page_dim)` on a 0–511 page grid
(docling_core's `_create_location_tokens_for_bbox`). We emit the same tokens
from our layout cluster boxes (`assemble.rs`, `norm_loc`) for text, headings,
tables, pictures, list items (on `ListItem.location`), code, and the
`page_header`/`page_footer` furniture blocks. Because our heron
layout model is docling's, the boxes agree to **~1 grid unit**; the small
residual is the aspect-ratio-stretch-vs-letterbox preprocessing difference, not a
structural gap. `dclx_diff.py` therefore counts a `<location>` pair as matching
when the two values are within `DCLX_TOL` (default **2**) grid units — **text,
tags, nesting, spans, and every non-geometry line stay byte-exact, and unmatched
lines always count against the score**. The tolerance is applied **only to PDF**,
where the reference geometry comes from docling's own layout run; formats whose
geometry is read from the same source file (OOXML slides/sheets) stay exact
(`DCLX_TOL=0`). `DCLX_TOL=0` reproduces a raw `diff` line-for-line.

### Per-fixture (±2)

Text/list-heavy pages land high (multi_page 82 %, right_to_left_02 82 %,
code_and_formula 81 %, 2305-pg9 78 %, right_to_left_01 75 %, amt 72 %,
normal_4pages 71 %, redp5110 65 %, 2206 61 %); the low ones are **model-level,
not provenance**: the big table papers (2203 51 %, 2305 52 %) diverge in
TableFormer cell structure (2203 alone is ~19 k table-grid diff lines),
table_mislabeled/picture_classification in layout classification, and
skipped_1/2page (Korean image pages) + right_to_left_03 in picture detection /
bidi — the *same* blockers that cap the Markdown metric. The corpus average is
bounded by these, so raising it further is a model problem, not a serialization
one: every laid-out block kind now carries provenance, so the ±2 figure sits at
the geometry-ignored ceiling.

## VLM pipeline conformance (#153/#311 — measured)

The remote-VLM pipeline (#77, `--pipeline vlm`) has its own comparison
harness: `scripts/conformance/vlm_conformance.sh` runs the PDF corpus through
docling.rs *and* Python docling's `VlmPipeline`, both against the same
endpoint (`scripts/dev/granite_vlm_server.py` — the only server class that
keeps granite-docling's DocTags tokens intact), and reports per-fixture
whitespace-normalized similarity plus byte-exactness. Known accepted
asymmetry: each side renders pages at its own scale, so some drift is
render-induced rather than parser-induced — triage before attributing.

**A GPU for the shim is a hard requirement, not a convenience** — measured
while dry-running the harness end-to-end for #311 (v1.23, 4-vCPU container,
fp32 `transformers` CPU inference of granite-docling-258M): a routine
academic page took **12 313 s (3.4 h) to generate 3 385 chars** (~0.1 tok/s;
a near-empty page still decodes at ~0.5 tok/s), while both clients cap a
page request at 600 s — the Rust agent's global timeout and
`vlm_convert.py`'s default alike. On CPU every real page therefore times out
client-side while the single-threaded shim grinds on as an orphan, blocking
the next request. That dry run did validate everything up to the model —
shim serving, both converters driving it, caching, scoring — and is what
shaped the harness fixes (venv `python3`, output-dir creation,
`--timeout`/`VLM_TIMEOUT`, the busy-shim probe hint, no-retry-on-timeout).
Reproduce with:

```bash
python scripts/dev/granite_vlm_server.py            # on a CUDA machine
scripts/conformance/setup-docling.sh
VLM_TIMEOUT=3600 scripts/conformance/vlm_conformance.sh   # prints the table + mean
```

### Measured results (#311)

Measured 2026-09-02 against `ibm-granite/granite-docling-258M` served by the
shim on an RTX 3080 Laptop (CUDA, bf16, greedy) — both sides drove the same
server; pages take roughly 390–590 s each at this model size on that GPU:

| fixture | sim% | byte-exact |
|---|---:|---|
| 2203.01017v2.pdf | 84.2 | no |
| 2206.01062.pdf | 59.2 | no |
| 2305.03393v1-pg9.pdf | 99.8 | no |
| 2305.03393v1.pdf | 58.8 | no |
| amt_handbook_sample.pdf | 98.6 | no |
| base14_fonts.pdf | 100.0 | **yes** |
| code_and_formula.pdf | 95.5 | no |
| docling-rs-demotion-repro.pdf | 94.2 | no |
| multi_page.pdf | 99.7 | no |
| normal_4pages.pdf | 67.5 | no |
| picture_classification.pdf | 100.0 | **yes** |
| redp5110_sampled.pdf | 78.9 | no |
| right_to_left_01.pdf | 97.8 | no |
| right_to_left_02.pdf | 69.1 | no |
| right_to_left_03.pdf | 100.0 | **yes** |
| skipped_1page.pdf | 98.4 | no |
| skipped_2pages.pdf | 95.7 | no |
| table_mislabeled_as_picture.pdf | 80.9 | no |

**Mean 87.7% over 18 fixtures, 3 byte-exact** (whitespace-normalized
character similarity of the two Markdown outputs, rust vs. Python docling).

Reading the numbers:

- Two conversions of the *same* page legitimately differ: each side renders
  at its own scale (docling.rs 144 dpi, Python docling 216 dpi), and the
  model's greedy decode is exquisitely sensitive to the input pixels — most
  of the gap on the mid-range fixtures (59–85%) is the model reading the two
  renders differently (dropped/merged cells in dense tables, different line
  wraps), not a parser divergence. Three byte-exact fixtures show the
  ceiling when the model answers identically.
- The long dense-table papers (2206.01062, 2305.03393v1) sit lowest — every
  page multiplies render-induced drift, and OTSL tables amplify a single
  mis-read cell into many token differences.
- Triage lesson baked into the harness: outputs cached from runs where a
  client timed out mid-corpus proved unreliable (two fixtures initially
  scored 1.3%/0.0% from stale artifacts and re-measured at 100.0/69.1) —
  delete `target/vlm-conformance/` after aborted runs rather than trusting
  survivors. A handful of table entries above (2203.01017v2, 2305.03393v1,
  redp5110_sampled) still carry early-run caches and read as lower bounds.

## Bedrock LLM comparison (speed + fuzzy conformance)

`scripts/conformance/bedrock_conformance.sh` benchmarks docling.rs against an
Amazon Bedrock model (Nova by default) prompted to extract each corpus PDF as
Markdown: docling.rs runs one warm CLI batch (set `DOCLING_RS_EP=cuda` for a
GPU run), Bedrock gets a timed Converse call per PDF, and both outputs score
against the committed groundtruth with a normalized line-similarity
percentage (byte-exactness is meaningless for an LLM, so both sides get the
same fuzzy metric). Needs boto3 plus `AWS_BEDROCK_REGION` /
`AWS_BEDROCK_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_BEDROCK_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` in the env; the
model, token cap and prompt are overridable (see the script header — note
Nova Micro is text-only per AWS docs, so PDF input may require
`AWS_BEDROCK_MODEL_ID=eu.amazon.nova-lite-v1:0`).

Measured baseline (2026-08, `eu.amazon.nova-lite-v1:0` in eu-central-1,
docling.rs on CPU with the conformance model pins) over the 14
groundtruth-scored PDFs:

| | total | per doc | mean similarity | converted |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| docling.rs (cpu) | 59.8 s | 4.3 s | **90.3 %** | 14/14 |
| nova-lite | 273.0 s | 21.0 s | 12.5 % | 13/14 |

Per file docling.rs scores 50.8–100 % (the low end is the same
`right_to_left_03` / `table_mislabeled_as_picture` tail the strict metric
tracks); Nova Lite tops out at 47.2 % (`multi_page`), returns 0 % on the RTL
fixtures, and one document failed with a `ModelErrorException` retry-please
error. A GPU run (`DOCLING_RS_EP=cuda`) shrinks the docling.rs column
roughly another order of magnitude (~0.1 s/page on a consumer RTX 3080).

## Enrichment models (opt-in)

docling's optional enrichment stages are ported behind the same flags
(`--enrich-picture-classes` / `--enrich-code` / `--enrich-formula`, docling's
`do_picture_classification` / `do_code_enrichment` / `do_formula_enrichment`)
and validated by `scripts/conformance/enrich_conformance.sh` against Python
docling 2.112's output on the enrichment fixtures
(`tests/data/pdf/groundtruth-enriched/`):

| Fixture | Check | Result |
|---|---|---|
| code_and_formula.pdf | Markdown, `--enrich-code --enrich-formula` | **byte-exact** (CodeFormulaV2's code rewrite, `JavaScript` language, formula LaTeX) |
| picture_classification.pdf | JSON classification annotation + meta | same class ranking; confidences match to ~3 decimals |

The CodeFormulaV2 export (`scripts/install/export_code_formula.py`) verifies
its three ONNX graphs' greedy decode **token-identical** to
`transformers.generate` before writing them. Its decoder also ships as a
dynamic INT8 quantization (`scripts/install/quantize_models.py
code-formula-decoder`, ~655 → ~165 MB, 4× less decoder RAM) that is preferred
automatically when present (`DOCLING_RS_FP32=1` opts out). Unlike the layout /
TableFormer INT8 models it is *near*-exact rather than byte-exact: greedy VLM
decoding has near-tie tokens that weight rounding can flip — on the fixture
the only drift is one extra blank line in the code block, and per-channel /
fp32-lm_head variants flip it identically, so the smaller per-tensor file is
kept. The conformance script gates fp32 byte-exact and allows the int8 leg
whitespace-only drift. The residual confidence drift on
the classifier comes from the crops: docling re-renders each region through
pdfium at the enrichment scale, while docling.rs resizes from the existing
scale-2 page render — sub-pixel differences the classifier's softmax sees in
the third decimal, and that the VLM's argmax decoding absorbs entirely on the
fixtures.

## How the pipeline works

pdfium extracts the glyph layer and renders each page to a bitmap; an ONNX stack
(layout detection, TableFormer, PaddleOCR) interprets it; regions are assembled in
reading order into a `DoclingDocument`. Note on OCR models: everything in this
document — snapshots, groundtruth, the conformance numbers — is measured with the
multilingual `ch_PP-OCRv3` recognition model (docling parity), which
`scripts/conformance/pdf_*.sh` pin via `DOCLING_OCR_REC_ONNX`/`DOCLING_OCR_DICT`.
The *runtime* default is the English `en_PP-OCRv3` pair (the `ch_` model glues
Latin words together); `DOCLING_RS_OCR_LANG=ch` restores the conformance model. Tables use **TableFormer** (image encoder
+ autoregressive OTSL structure decoder + cell-bbox decoder, ported and exported
to ONNX in `tableformer.rs`) on a cv2-exact preprocessed crop (`resample.rs`); the
structure + matched cell text reproduce docling's padded GitHub tables (2305-pg9
is cell-for-cell exact).

**Heading levels (#302, opt-in).** With `--heading-hierarchy` (off by default —
everything in this document is measured with it off), a post-assembly stage
ports docling's `HeadingHierarchyModel`: section-header levels are assigned
from the PDF outline (bookmarks, fuzzily matched by title + page; a matched
list item is promoted to a heading), else legal/outline numbering, else font
style (glyph-height clustering + the conservative font-name weight/slant
parser). It runs on the assembled node stream (`heading_hierarchy.rs`,
`outline.rs`, `font_style.rs` in docling-pdf) and rewrites only heading
levels, so the default-off output — and every snapshot below — is untouched.

**Rotated scans.** Two normalization passes run before any inference, both only
on pages with no text layer (exactly the OCR set), both mapped back to
display-space geometry at assembly via `PdfPage::rotation`:

1. **`/Rotate` metadata** (`pdfium_backend::extract_page`): pdfium renders the
   page as displayed, so a declared rotation is un-rotated losslessly and
   `width`/`height` swap. Pinned by `crates/docling/tests/scanned.rs` — all
   four `/Rotate` orientations of `ocr_test.pdf` OCR byte-identically.
2. **Content-based orientation** (`orient.rs`, #225): a physically rotated
   raster (`/Rotate 0` — sideways phone photo, landscape-fed sheet) is probed
   with the recognizer itself, the classic OSD trick: segment the page with
   the same projection segmentation OCR uses, recognize up to 6 of the widest
   line crops under each 90° hypothesis, score by Σ(confidence × chars). An
   upright page early-exits after one probe round (≥20 chars at ≥0.90 mean
   confidence); a rotated hypothesis must read real text (≥8 chars at ≥0.55)
   *and* beat upright by 1.2× to win — thin evidence (blank/line-art pages)
   is a no-op, and any probe failure degrades to "assume upright". Scores are
   deterministic (single-threaded rec, fixed probe selection), so snapshots
   hold. `DOCLING_RS_OCR_ORIENTATION=off` disables the pass;
   `DOCLING_RS_DEBUG=1` prints per-hypothesis scores. Pinned by the
   `ocr_test_raster*` fixtures (the same lossless raster physically rotated
   inside the page): all four convert byte-identically.

### Performance / parallelism

Profiling a 14-page document (`DOCLING_RS_TIMING=1` prints an env-gated per-stage
wall-clock breakdown) shows ~80 % of the time is the two ONNX models (layout ~58 %,
TableFormer ~22 %) and ~16 % the page-image downsample — all per-page work that is
independent across pages. A multi-page PDF therefore renders on one thread (pdfium
is not thread-safe) and fans the pages out across a **pool of page-workers**, each
owning its own model set (`ort`'s `Session::run` is `&mut self`, so sessions can't
be shared), reassembled in page order. A bounded channel keeps only a handful of
page bitmaps resident, so the streaming memory profile is preserved; the output is
byte-identical to the serial path (verified across all PDF snapshots). Single-page /
image / METS inputs keep the serial path and load no helper models.

The layout model is **memory-bandwidth bound** (even one model at four intra-op
threads only reaches ~2.1× core utilisation), so the pool defaults to two intra-op
threads per worker with `workers ≈ cores / 2` (ceiling 16 — a memory bound of
~0.4 GB of model sessions per worker, not a performance cap; #324 follow-up
measured the old cap of 4 leaving ~1.2× on the table on a 16-core machine): two threads sharing one
in-cache copy of the weights beats both one fat model and many single-thread workers.
The speed-up scales with cores and memory bandwidth. Tune per machine with
`DOCLING_RS_PDF_WORKERS` (pool size) and `DOCLING_RS_PDF_INTRA` (intra-op threads
per worker). Each worker layout-detects up to `DOCLING_RS_PDF_LAYOUT_BATCH`
already-rendered pages per inference call (issue #73; default: per-page on
the CPU provider, 4 when a GPU provider is selected — #338: every CPU
measurement favors per-page, 8.5 vs 9.3 s/conv on a 4-core x86 box and ~2×
on a 16-core M4 Max, while GPU dispatch overhead still amortizes). In
per-page mode the model's dynamic `batch` axis is pinned to 1 at session
creation (#339): the free dimension blocks ONNX Runtime's channels-last conv
transform (~1.4× on Apple-silicon CPU); x86 measured neutral. Output is
bit-identical at every batch size, so the knob is purely about throughput.

### Text reconstruction: a pure-Rust PDF text parser (default)

The byte-exact ceiling was the **text extractor** — pdfium's *rendered* glyph
boxes diverge from docling's own `docling-parse` C++ parser at exactly the points
that drive conformance (generated spaces, combining marks, ligature/fraction
positioning). The pipeline now ships a **pure-Rust text parser** (`textparse.rs`,
on `lopdf`) that reconstructs each glyph's box from the *font's own advance
widths* and the PDF text/graphics matrices — the same information docling-parse
uses. It is the **default** text layer; set `DOCLING_PDFIUM_TEXT=1` to fall back
to pdfium. Pages without a parseable text layer fall back to pdfium
automatically, so scanned/OCR pages are unaffected. The parser supplies **all**
text — prose, the **word cells** TableFormer matches against, and **code cells**
(`DOCLING_PDFIUM_WORDS` reverts words+code to pdfium; `DOCLING_PDFIUM_TEXT`
reverts everything). pdfium now does only page rasterisation + link annotations.

The parser handles Type0/CID + Identity-H and simple Type1/TrueType fonts,
ToUnicode CMaps (`bfchar`/`bfrange`), WinAnsi/MacRoman + `/Differences`
encodings, **Form XObject recursion** (`Do` — bulk body text in heavy PDFs lives
inside a form; 2206 p1 was dropping ~9000 chars), a **glyph-name fallback**
(docling emits an unmappable subset-font name verbatim, `/g115`), and an
**overprint dedup** (a kashida elongation re-stamped on itself — right_to_left_02).
A char-frequency validator (`scripts/test/parser_completeness.py`) confirms nothing is
silently skipped.

Its cells feed the ported **docling-parse line sanitizer** (`dp_lines.rs`, from
`src/parse/page_item_sanitators/cells.h`): a 3-pass corner-distance contraction
(LTR → RTL → LTR-reverse) with `merge_with` space insertion (one space when the
gap exceeds 0.33×avg-char-width, plus literal space glyphs), `enforce_same_font`,
ligature recomposition, and loose-box geometry. On the clean parser boxes it uses
the Euclidean corner gap (matching docling); on pdfium's loose boxes it keeps the
signed horizontal gap.

**Word cells** come from a second contraction over the same char cells
(`create_word_cells`, see the word-cell section above): the word factors
(adjacency gate 0.33, space threshold 2 × 0.33) with space glyphs dropped up
front as pure word-boundary barriers — verified against the installed
docling-parse oracle (redp5110 pages byte-exact). These are the per-word
tokens TableFormer matches against table-grid cells, replacing pdfium's word
cells (roadmap item 6). **Code cells** come from the parser too,
via a gap-based grouping (`Grouping::CodeGap`): the parser emits no space glyphs
(a source space is a positioning gap), so a word breaks wherever the inter-glyph
gap exceeds ~0.25× the line height, with no punctuation glue — `et al. 2000`
keeps its space while `add(a,` / `b)` stay joined. `code_and_formula` is byte-exact
(`function add(a, b) { return a + b; }`). With this, pdfium's text path is fully
retired (rasters + links only).

Other text/serializer/layout fixes matching docling: markdown escaping (`_`→`\_`,
then HTML-escape `&`/`<`/`>`), typographic-punctuation normalization
(`’`→`'`, `–`/`—`→`-`, `“”`→`"`, or `'` for Hangul fonts), `@`-glue
(`mAP @0.5`), wrap dehyphenation, paragraph-continuation merging across
column/page breaks, band-aware two-column reading order, **false-picture
suppression** (empty low-confidence margin boxes on text pages), and
**page-number-first** ordering.

## Remaining blockers (model-level)

These yield smaller or uncertain gains than the text-layer work already shipped.
The issues that tracked them (#60–#63) are **closed**: everything
heuristic-level in them landed, and what remains below is the documented
model-level (or by-design) residual each issue closed with:

1. **TableFormer structure on complex tables**
   ([#60](https://github.com/docling-project/docling.rs/issues/60)). The
   *matching* half is done: docling's `MatchingPostProcessor` (cell-class-aware
   good/bad IOU split, column-median snapping, adjacent-column de-duplication,
   best-intersection word assignment, row/column-band orphan pickup) is ported
   in `tf_match.rs` and is the default word→cell matcher, and the table crop
   reproduces docling's exact rounding chain (`round(bbox) → ×2 → ×1024/h →
   round`, banker's rounding) — 2203 157→150, redp5110 204→202, everything else
   unchanged. The rest is **model-level**: the OTSL tag stream itself differs
   from live docling on the hard crops (redp5110's TOC predicts `ched` where
   docling gets `fcel`; multi-row headers / spans on 2206, 2203), so one
   cell-structure diff still cascades through the padded columns into many row
   diffs (at the time, 2206's ~92 table-row diffs traced to ~4 structure
   diffs; today its one remaining table diff is a single header rowspan). A parity
   harness (`DOCLING_RS_TF_MATCH_DUMP=dir` + `scripts/test/tf_match_reference.py`-style
   replay through docling's Python post-processor) confirmed the ported matcher
   reproduces the reference on identical inputs, isolating the residual to the
   model predictions. `DOCLING_RS_TF_SIMPLE_MATCH=1` reverts to the pre-port
   best-overlap matcher.
2. **Layout classification**
   ([#61](https://github.com/docling-project/docling.rs/issues/61)) — *addressed
   by porting docling's `LayoutPostprocessor`.* The raw RT-DETR detections now go
   through the cleanup docling applies before assembly: per-label confidence
   thresholds (`CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLDS`, stricter than the 0.3 base — a
   picture/table/list needs ≥ 0.5), regular/picture/wrapper **bucketed** overlap
   resolution (a high-score picture no longer suppresses a lower-score table or
   table-of-contents index), the picture-vs-table cross-type rule
   (`_handle_cross_type_overlaps`), and dropping a regular region absorbed by a
   table/index/picture so it isn't emitted twice. With this, table_mislabeled's
   survey over-detection dropped sharply at the time (108 → 88 vs groundtruth;
   54 today — over-detection remains its dominant blocker), and
   redp5110's table-of-contents is now classified and rendered as a **table**
   (`document_index`) instead of a picture. The TOC table's remaining diff is a
   TableFormer dot-leader column-matching gap — later found to be largely
   word-cell tokenization (the create_word_cells port took redp5110 164→73)
   — tracked with the other
   table-structure work in
   [#60](https://github.com/docling-project/docling.rs/issues/60). *(The
   per-fixture byte counts quoted in this item are from its era; the committed
   snapshots and the Current-state table above are regenerated with every
   parity change.)*
3. **Complex title-page reading order**
   ([#62](https://github.com/docling-project/docling.rs/issues/62)). Author-block
   / abstract interleaving on the academic papers (band reading-order handles the
   full-width title; the in-column author/abstract order is still off). Two
   pieces landed: the suspected "TeX-font quote decode" gap turned out to be
   docling-parse's *sanitizer* table (every curly quote → `'`; a `"` only ever
   comes from a literal `quotedbl` glyph) — no font-program parsing needed —
   and region cells now join in docling-parse index order (docling's
   `_sort_cells`), which fixes off-baseline glyph drift like 2206's inline
   math `>` landing on the wrong line.
4. **amt fraction double space (text-layer, strict-only)**
   ([#63](https://github.com/docling-project/docling.rs/issues/63)). docling boxes glyphs
   with the embedded font's OS/2 typographic metrics, not the PDF descriptor's;
   that ~0.3 pt difference makes its justified line insert a *second* space before
   the `1⁄4` numerator. Our single-spaced output is the more faithful rendering
   (the whitespace-normalized metric credits it); reproducing docling's exact
   spacing needs an embedded-font metrics layer, which globally entangles with RTL
   box geometry (a trial that fixed one `¼` regressed `right_to_left_01`). See
   `MIGRATION.md` §4. **Resolved as by-design:** our single space is the correct
   rendering, so #63 is closed without matching docling's spurious extra space —
   forcing a byte-match would degrade output and risk the RTL geometry.

## Performance — review & profiling notes

Post-migration review of the PDF processing path: where the time actually goes,
what was measured, which optimizations are validated, and a ranked backlog of
further ideas that do **not** trade away output quality.

### Results at a glance

Everything below was landed across two optimization rounds (PR #26, #27),
each change gated on corpus conformance — groundtruth distance unchanged or
better, byte-identical where the change is structural:

| Optimization | Measured effect |
|---|---|
| INT8 layout model (Conv-only static QDQ, calibrated; **default**) | layout inference **2.4×** faster; **1.83× end-to-end** on a 1913-page PDF (0.74 → 0.40 s/page) |
| INT8 TableFormer decoder (dynamic, **default**) | ~10% faster table decode, byte-identical |
| SIMD page downscale (`fast_image_resize`, same kernel; **default**) | `image.resize` stage **17×** faster (2607 → 152 ms / 16 pages) |
| TableFormer KV cache fed back as `ort` values (no per-step copy) | ~9% faster table-structure decode, byte-identical |
| One shared lazy TableFormer across the worker pool | peak RSS **3.8 → 1.9 GB** (4 workers); table-free docs 682 → 331 MB |
| Single shared line/word contraction pass | `--no-ocr` conversion ~1.25× faster, identical output |
| Per-document font + form caches in the text parser | 3–10% off `textparse` here; far more on CJK/form-heavy PDFs |
| True-KV-cache decoder export (`decoder_kv.onnx`, optional) | parity at corpus table sizes; O(past)/step for very large tables |
| Dynamic-batch `decoder_kv.onnx`: a page's tables decode in one lockstep loop | decode steps shared across tables; byte-identical (see round four below) |

Cumulative head-to-head vs Python docling (measured on an 8-thread desktop,
`scripts/test/performance.sh`): **4.3× faster warm conversion, 4.7× end-to-end,
2.3–2.6× less peak memory** on the PDF ML pipeline — up from ~1.2× warm
before this work. Model sizes: layout 172 → 68 MB, TF decoder 78 → 50 MB.

A re-measure on the final stack (hoisted-KV TableFormer decoder default per
#97; different desktop, Jul 2026) with `performance.sh
tests/data/pdf/sources/2305.03393v1-pg9.pdf` — a single table-dense page, so
the page-parallel worker pool sits mostly idle and this bounds the *low* end
of the speedup range: **3.0× end-to-end** (16.3 → 5.4 s avg over 5 runs),
**2.0× warm conversion** (9.1 → 4.7 s/doc), **1.9× less peak memory**
(1589 → 857 MB).
Also fixed along the way: the `"` show-text operator dropped its word/char
spacing operands (real spec violation), and OCR/TableFormer sub-stages are
now visible in `DOCLING_RS_TIMING` profiles.

Measured on a 4-core AVX-512(+VNNI/AMX) Xeon, release build (`lto = "thin"`),
models from `scripts/install/download_dependencies.sh`, `DOCLING_RS_TIMING=1`.

### Where the time goes

Per-stage wall-clock share (summed across workers):

| Stage | 1913-page text-heavy PDF¹ | 16-page table-heavy paper² | scanned page³ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `layout.predict` (RT-DETR ONNX) | **80.3%** | 55.4% | 64.9% |
| `image.resize` (3×→2× CatmullRom) | 14.9% | 7.9% | 18.5% |
| `tableformer` | 2.8% | 32.1% | — |
| `pdfium.render` | 1.8% | 3.7% | 16.5% |
| `textparse` + assembly | ~0.2% | ~0.3% | ~0.1% |

¹ `tests/data/pdf/large/dotnet-csharp-language-reference.pdf` — 936 s wall, ~0.49 s/page.
² `tests/data/pdf/sources/2203.01017v2.pdf`.
³ `tests/data/scanned/sources/ocr_test.pdf`.

Two conclusions drive everything below:

1. **ONNX inference is ~85–95% of PDF conversion time.** All the Rust-side text
   extraction, parsing, and assembly work combined is under 1%. Rust-code
   micro-optimizations are irrelevant to PDF throughput until the models get
   faster; model-level and preprocessing-level changes are the only levers that
   matter.
2. Within TableFormer, the **autoregressive decode loop** dominates
   (`tableformer.structure` ≈ 96% of the stage; the per-table page resample
   `tableformer.inter_area` is ~1% of a conversion).

The worker-pool topology heuristic in `lib.rs` (`workers × intra ≈ cores`,
default 2×2 on 4 cores) was re-validated: 2×2 beat both 4×1 and 1×4 on the
16-page document (11.6 s vs 12.2 s vs 15.6 s; separate run from the INT8
table below, hence the ±0.1 s vs its 11.5 s).

### Validated win: INT8 quantization (quality-checked)

`scripts/install/quantize_models.py` produces two quantized models. Point
`DOCLING_LAYOUT_ONNX` / `DOCLING_TABLEFORMER_DECODER` at them to opt in.

**These are now the default:** when the `*_int8` files sit next to the fp32
models at the default paths, the pipeline loads them automatically.
`DOCLING_RS_FP32=1` forces full precision, and an explicit
`DOCLING_LAYOUT_ONNX` / `DOCLING_TABLEFORMER_DECODER` always wins (the
conformance/groundtruth scripts pin fp32 explicitly, so snapshots stay
deterministic).

#### TableFormer encoder: not quantized, but half its size (#374)

The encoder is a ~20-Conv ResNet backbone feeding a 6-layer transformer, and
the transformer Gemms — not the convs — are its cost. INT8 was measured and
rejected: conv-only static QDQ keeps fidelity (enc_out / cross-K/V cosine
≥ 0.995) but is not faster than ORT's fp32 conv kernels, and quantizing the
attention MatMuls collapses cross-attention fidelity to ~0.85 (garbled table
structure). What *was* wrong with the published 215 MiB `encoder.onnx` is
exporter waste: the explicit all-false attention mask handed to the
transformer encoder was materialized as a zero `[1,8,784,784]` fp32 constant
(18.8 MiB) baked into each of the six layers — 112.6 MiB of `x + 0` around
103 MiB of real weights (42.6 MiB Conv, 60 MiB MatMul/Gemm).
`scripts/install/strip_zero_masks.py` (run by the export) removes those `Add`
nodes; the stripped graph's outputs are bit-identical to the original's
(onnxruntime, max |diff| = 0), so the republished encoder changes nothing but
the download. On top of that, `encoder_fp16.onnx` (`quantize_models.py
tableformer-encoder-fp16`) stores the same graph's weights as fp16 behind a
`Cast` back to fp32 — ORT folds the cast at load, so compute, speed and
memory are those of the fp32 encoder and only the file shrinks, 103 → 54 MB
(4.2× below the original 226 MB). Fidelity gate on the 54 calibration inputs:
cosine ≥ 0.999999, relative L2 error ≤ 1.5e-3 per output tensor; and over the
full 101-file snapshot corpus the fp16 encoder's Markdown is **byte-identical**
to the fp32 encoder's (same machine, same binary, `diff -rq` empty). It is
therefore preferred when present, like the INT8 decoder; `DOCLING_RS_FP32=1`
or an explicit `DOCLING_TABLEFORMER_ENCODER` keeps the fp32 file. INT8 for
the encoder stays off the table.

#### Layout: static QDQ INT8, **Conv ops only** (~2.4× faster layout)

Calibrated on 42 real corpus pages preprocessed exactly like
`layout.rs::predict`. Only the HGNetv2 backbone convolutions are quantized;
the transformer decoder and detection-head MatMuls stay fp32.

| Configuration | layout.predict (16-page doc)¹ | end-to-end wall | model size |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| fp32 baseline | 17.2 s | 16.6 s | 172 MB |
| **INT8 conv-only** | **7.2 s (2.4×)** | 11.5 s (1.45×) | 68 MB |
| + INT8 TableFormer decoder | — | 12.3 s² | — |

¹ `layout.predict` is summed across the parallel page workers, so it can
exceed the end-to-end wall.
² Separate run; within run-to-run noise of the 11.5 s conv-only wall — the
INT8 decoder's own win is per-table (~10 % faster tables, byte-identical;
see its section below), not end-to-end on this document.

On text-dominated documents (layout = 80% of time) the end-to-end gain
approaches ~1.7–2×; on table-heavy ones it is ~1.4×.

Full-scale run — the 1913-page `dotnet-csharp-language-reference.pdf`,
INT8 layout + INT8 TableFormer decoder vs fp32, same machine and binary,
back-to-back:

| | fp32 | INT8 | ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| wall clock | 1406 s (0.74 s/page) | **770 s (0.40 s/page)** | **1.83×** |
| `layout.predict` (summed) | 2667 s | 1350 s | 1.98× |
| output difference | — | 1199 of 52,615 Markdown lines (2.3%) | |

The 2.3% of differing lines are the same near-threshold classification flips
seen on the corpus (where groundtruth conformance measured *equal or slightly
better* under INT8 — 812 vs 833 summed diff-lines), not a systematic
degradation. With layout halved, `image.resize` becomes the next stage
(24.8% of the INT8 run), which is why backlog item 4 matters more after
quantization.

**Quality gate** (measured at INT8-selection time over the then-23-file
PDF+scanned corpus):

- Conv-only INT8: 12/23 byte-identical to fp32; remaining diffs are small
  region-classification flips. Against the committed groundtruth the summed
  diff-line distance is **812 (INT8) vs 833 (fp32)** — i.e. conformance-neutral
  (INT8 is marginally better on 3 fixtures, marginally worse on 2).
- Full INT8 (convs + MatMuls) was **rejected**: 3/23 exact, with clear quality
  loss (section headers demoted to plain text, page-footer text leaking into
  the output) — the RT-DETR head's class scores sit near the 0.3 threshold and
  cannot tolerate activation quantization.
- Dynamic (weights-only) INT8 of the whole layout model was also rejected: it
  is *slower* than fp32 (3.2 s vs 2.1 s per page-with-table) because inserted
  per-activation quantize ops outweigh the MatMul savings while the conv
  backbone stays fp32.

##### 7-bit weights: the same model on every x86 CPU

The quantizer emits **7-bit** weights (`reduce_range=True`). u8 activations
times s8 weights go through `VPMADDUBSW` on CPUs without VNNI, and that
instruction sums two products into one int16 slot: full-range weights reach
255·127·2 = 64770 and saturate at 32767, so a model that measures perfectly on
the machine that quantized it can drop whole regions on a plain AVX2 CPU.
Not hypothetical — a publish run's agreement gate lost **83 of 505** confident
detections (two of them tables) on a runner without VNNI, while the same recipe
over a structurally identical export lost **1** on a VNNI box. 7 bits caps the
pair product at 255·64·2 = 32640, below saturation.

It costs nothing. Same VNNI machine, same corpus, 4 intra-op threads (the
ratios are the point, not the absolute times — this is a shared container, not
the benchmark box the table above was measured on):

| layout_heron | agreement gate (505 confident fp32 detections) | 640×640 inference |
|---|---:|---:|
| fp32 | — | 548 ms |
| INT8, full-range weights | 1 lost (0.20%) | 290 ms |
| **INT8, 7-bit weights** | **0 lost (0.00%)** | **282 ms** |

`quantize_models.py` checks the weight range right after quantizing
(`check_weight_range`), before the accuracy gate. Reading weights is
hardware-independent, so a recipe that reintroduces full-range weights fails on
the publishing machine instead of on a user's laptop — the accuracy gate alone
cannot catch this, since it only ever exercises the ISA it happens to run on.
An int8 layout model fetched before this change is full-range: on a non-VNNI
CPU, refetch after the next models publish, or set `DOCLING_RS_FP32=1`.

##### BatchNorm folded before quantization (~1.4× faster int8 layout)

A re-profile (Sep 2026, 4-core Xeon, ORT node profiler on the int8 graph)
found ~40% of layout inference in fp32 elementwise ops that the fp32 path
never executes: `Mul` 13%, `Add` 12%, `DequantizeLinear` 12%,
`QuantizeLinear` 4%. The HGNetv2 export spells eval-mode BatchNorm as
`Conv → Mul(1,C,1,1) → Add(1,C,1,1)`; in an fp32 session ONNX Runtime's
ConvMulFusion/ConvAddFusion fold that into one FusedConv at load, but the
QDQ quantizer wraps the Conv in Quantize/Dequantize pairs that block the
fusion, so every one of the backbone's 110 normalizations ran as
`DQ → Mul → Add → Q` over the full activation tensor. `quantize_models.py`
now folds the 55 pairs into the conv weights and bias first
(`fold_conv_affine`: `(W∗x)·s + t == (W·s)∗x + t`, exact up to the fp32
rounding the runtime fusion performs as well) and the graph collapses to
back-to-back QLinearConvs.

Folding alone moved int8/fp32 agreement sideways (mean |Δscore| over the
1045 above-threshold fp32 detections on the calibration pages 0.049 → 0.051),
so the activation ranges now come from `CalibMovingAverage` — per-page
min/max averaged instead of corpus-wide extremes, so one outlier page no
longer sets the u8 grid for all. Entropy and percentile calibration were
tried on the same graph and landed in between (0.046 / 0.043), on top of
needing every activation sample in RAM (the 52-page set does not fit in
15 GB). Same box, same corpus, single-thread ORT for the output diffs:

| layout_heron_int8 recipe | 2 thr | 4 thr | mean \|Δscore\| vs fp32 | lost (of 1045) | Markdown diff-lines vs fp32 (24 docs) | vs groundtruth (17 docs) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| previous (unfolded, MinMax) | 602 ms | 381 ms | 0.049 | 38 | 327 | 564 |
| folded, MinMax | 453 ms | 289 ms | 0.051 | 48 | 345 | 576 |
| folded, MinMax moving average | 424 ms | 289 ms | 0.037 | 28 | 290 | 563 |
| **+ stem convs `embedder.0/1` fp32** | **≈ same¹** | **≈ same¹** | **0.022** | **15** | **146** | **423** |

¹ Interleaved bench, 30 iterations: 350.3 vs 348.6 ms (2 thr), 247.4 vs
249.9 ms (4 thr) against the all-int8 row — inside run-to-run noise. The
whole stem in fp32 (`embedder.2` too) would have cost ~12% for 0.020 / 17;
`embedder.0` alone buys little (0.035 / 19).

The quantization error concentrates at the front of the backbone: the two
stem convs see the raw pixels at 320×320, the largest maps in the graph, and
their u8 rounding rides through every later stage. Leaving those two in fp32
takes the int8 model's distance to fp32 output from 327 to **146** diff-lines
(`redp5110_sampled` 99 → 2, `right_to_left_03` 46 → 0) and its groundtruth
distance from 564 to **423** — fp32 itself sits at 411, so the int8 default
now costs 3% of conformance instead of 37%. Entropy and percentile
calibration were also tried (in between MinMax and moving average, and they
need every activation sample in RAM). Both gates pass on every row (0/505
confident detections lost; weights within 7 bits). Pipeline effect,
back-to-back cold CLI runs, default 2×2 pool, with the two changes below:
the 60-page slice of the .NET reference 34.5–34.9 s → **21.0–21.4 s
(−39%)**; the table-heavy `2206.01062` 13.2–13.4 s → **9.1–9.8 s (−30%)**.

##### Text layer parsed per page, not up front

`for_each_page` used to run the pure-Rust text parser over *every* page of
the document before rendering the first one: a 6.5 s serial prefix on the
1913-page .NET reference that the page-worker pool sat idle through, and a
`--pages` window still paid for all 1913 pages (14% of a 60-page slice's
wall time). `PageTextParser` keeps the loaded document and the font/form
caches and parses a page when the render walk reaches it — 0.58 s to open
the document plus ~2.4 ms per selected page, overlapped with the workers'
inference. Same glyph walk, same shared caches, same contraction per page:
Markdown output is byte-identical over the PDF corpus, the scanned fixtures
and the 60-page slice (single-thread ORT, old vs new binary).
`DOCLING_RS_TIMING` now reports `textparse.open` plus a per-page `textparse`.

##### Pages parked on a busy TableFormer, not blocked

The pool shares one TableFormer behind a mutex (the memory win above), and a
worker whose page had a table used to block on it for the whole of another
worker's decode: on the 60-page slice ~9.5 s of the `tableformer` stage was
one worker idle (stage 22.5 s vs `tableformer.structure` 11.5 s +
`inter_area` 1.5 s), and pool topology could not buy it back — 2×2, 4×1 and
3×1 all landed within noise. `finish_page` is now `prepare_page` → table
stage → `complete_page`, and the pool path (`Worker::run_pool`, shared by
the buffered and streaming conversions) tries the slot without blocking:
when it is held, the prepared page is parked and the worker keeps pulling
from the render channel, retrying parked pages before every pull. While
pages are parked the pull is non-blocking, so an empty channel means "wait
for the TableFormer", never "hold work while waiting for the renderer". At
most two parked pages per worker (their bitmaps are the memory cost); past
that, or once the channel closes, the worker waits as before. Output does
not depend on completion order — both callers reassemble by page index —
verified byte-identical over 23 documents on a 2-worker pool with
single-thread sessions. On `2206.01062` the stage's wait fell from ~10 s to
~1.9 s (stage 8.3 s vs structure 6.0 s + inter_area 0.4 s).

##### Pillow-exact resize over rows

`pil_resize` (the docling-parity 1.5×→1× layout image on the render thread,
and the 640×640 layout input in each worker) went through
`get_pixel`/`put_pixel` per tap and walked the vertical pass by column:
~30 ms per page, slower than the SIMD 3×→2× downscale of a bigger image.
Both passes now run over raw rows with one i32 accumulator row for the
vertical pass. The arithmetic is unchanged and purely integer, so the bytes
are identical (the Pillow reference hashes pin that); `image.resize_layout`
is 11–12 ms per page. The render thread's remaining per-page work — two
pdfium renders plus the two downscales, ~110 ms — is not the bottleneck at
4 cores but caps a many-core pool at roughly 9 pages/s.

##### Round two (Sep 2026): the fixed costs

With inference trimmed, a second profile of the merged stack looked at what a
conversion pays regardless of page count. All four changes below are
output-neutral: Markdown over the PDF corpus, the scanned/rotated fixtures and
the 60-page slice is byte-identical with and without them, on the serial path
(single-thread ORT) and on a 2-worker pool.

- **The page window loaded every page.** `for_each_page` walked
  `pages.iter()` from page 0 and skipped to `first`, so pdfium loaded and
  closed every page before the window — ~0.7 ms each. A one-page `--no-ocr`
  window over the 1913-page .NET reference took 3.1 s, of which the parser
  accounted for 0.4 s; indexing the window with `pages.get(i)` brings it to
  **0.85 s** (the full pipeline on that page: 4.1 → 2.1 s, `--pages 1-60`
  no-ocr 2.7 → 1.0 s). The parser's teardown — 250 ms of lopdf objects on
  that document — now happens on a detached thread (`textparse.close` still
  reports it) instead of delaying the last page.
- **Session creation is graph optimization.** Creating the int8 layout
  session costs ~0.8 s (4 threads) and the TableFormer encoder ~1 s; each
  process, each pool worker. ONNX Runtime can serialize the optimized graph
  and load it with the optimizer off in ~0.15 s, running the identical
  kernels. `docling_onnx::commit` keeps such a cache
  (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/docling-rs/graphs`, `DOCLING_RS_GRAPH_CACHE_DIR`,
  `DOCLING_RS_NO_GRAPH_CACHE=1`), keyed on the model file, the session
  options that shape the graph, the ONNX Runtime API version and the CPU's
  SIMD features (the saved graph carries hardware-specific NCHWc kernels);
  CPU provider only, and every failure on the cached path falls back to the
  ordinary load. A one-page digital PDF: **1.26 → 0.68 s** wall (the first
  run after a model or machine change pays ~0.16 s extra to write the cache).
- **OCR ran on one core while three idled.** Recognition is pinned to a
  single intra-op thread for determinism (multi-threaded float reductions
  flip CTC argmaxes on low-confidence characters), and it is linear in line
  width — ~0.17 ms per pixel column, no batching benefit, no new-shape
  penalty (measured). Lines are independent, so `OcrModel` now holds one
  single-thread session per lane (the worker's thread budget;
  `DOCLING_RS_OCR_SESSIONS` overrides) and deals same-width batches across
  them by index; each line still meets exactly the single-thread kernel
  path. On `ocr_test.pdf`, 4 lanes: `ocr.rec` 374 → 188 ms, `orient.score`
  429 → 225 ms, wall 1.62 → 1.33 s; `nemotron_multipage` 6.5 → 4.1 s.
- **The orientation probe was a second OCR pass.** Sub-stage timers showed
  `orient.detect` on a scan is ~95% recognition: it reads the six *widest*
  lines, and on a small scan those are most of the page's text — the probe
  (467 ms) cost more than `ocr.rec` for the whole page (393 ms). The lanes
  halve it; the remaining lever is a smaller probe budget, not taken here
  because it changes the evidence the decision is made on.

Pool-path effect of this round, back-to-back runs: `2203.01017v2` 9.8 →
8.0–8.1 s (its in-picture table OCR rides the lanes), `2206.01062` 9.1–9.8 →
8.2–9.6 s, the 60-page slice 21.0–21.4 → 19.4–21.6 s.
##### Round three (Sep 2026): inside a table

Sub-stage timers (`tf.preprocess`, `tf.encoder`, `tf.decode_loop`,
`tf.bbox`, alongside `tf.decode_step`) split the ~1 s per table on
`2206.01062` (4 threads) into: decode loop 0.53 s (~107 steps, ~5 ms each),
bbox head 0.26 s, encoder 0.20 s, page→1024 resample 0.11 s, preprocessing
5 ms. Three exact fixes came out of that, one dead end, and one wall.

- **The bbox head fought the memory-pattern planner.** Its `tag_h` input is
  `[ncells, 512]` and every table has a different cell count, so ONNX
  Runtime re-planned buffer reuse on every run — and on this graph the plan
  is worse than none: 290 ms vs 54 ms for a 100-cell table, 560 vs 94 ms
  for 200 cells (repeat runs, 4 threads; the decoder session already ran
  without the planner for the same reason). Off now; the head still pays
  first-shape allocation per table because every table *is* a new shape.
- **One 1024-px frame per page.** The page→1024 INTER_AREA resample (a
  full-page f64 box filter, 110–170 ms) ran once per *table*;
  `TableFormer::page_1024` builds it once per page and every table crops
  from it. `2203.01017v2`: 8 → 4 resamples.
- **The decoder runs on one intra-op thread.** A step is 49 small GEMMs
  over a single token: it streams the layer weights (~70 MB per step) rather
  than computing, so threads only add synchronisation — isolated, 4.1 ms per
  step on 1 thread vs 5.5 on 4 (4.9 vs 7.1 once the KV cache is 100+ long).
  In the pool a table decode also stops taking every core from the other
  workers' layout inference, and a single-thread session has a fixed
  reduction order, so table structure no longer varies run-to-run on
  near-tie tokens (the conformance scripts pinned one thread for exactly
  that; the default matches them now). The encoder keeps the shared budget:
  680 ms single-threaded vs 165 on four.
- **Dead end: graph simplification.** The exported step graph has 449 nodes,
  ~415 executed per step, 275 of them Reshape/Transpose/Squeeze/Unsqueeze/
  Concat. `onnxsim` takes it to 383 nodes, bit-identical — and no faster
  (5.2 → 5.2 ms): ONNX Runtime already folds what can be folded at load, and
  the shape ops that remain are dispatch noise next to the GEMMs (42% of
  node time).
- **The wall.** What is left per table is the encoder's real compute (a
  448×448 CNN + transformer pass, 165 ms on 4 threads) and the decoder's
  weight streaming. Both move only with the model: INT8/fp16 weights for the
  step (the dynamic-INT8 `decoder_kv` was already tried and rejected — it
  flips near-tie tokens on redp5110's TOC), or batching several tables'
  steps through one run so the weights stream once for all of them. The
  first is not byte-exact by construction; the second turned out to be —
  round four below.

Back-to-back, same machine, default pool: `2206.01062` 9.4–9.6 → 8.8 s,
`2203.01017v2` 8.0–8.1 → 7.9 s, `2305.03393v1-pg9` (one 55-step table on
one page) 2.4 s. Output is byte-identical to the round-two references on the
serial path and on a 2-worker pool over the same 32 documents.

#### Round four (Sep 2026): a page's tables decode together

The decode step streams ~70 MB of layer weights for one token, so the
obvious lever left after round three was to push several tables' tokens
through the same step. It needed a dynamic-batch `decoder_kv.onnx` and a
loop that keeps the tables' KV caches aligned — and, unlike the earlier
guess, no masking at all.

- **The export** (`export_tableformer.py`, `DecodeKVHoistedBatched`): `tag`
  is `[B,1]`, the caches `[L,B,H,past,hd]`, every cross tensor `[B,…]`; B=1
  is the same graph, so the artifact stays a drop-in for a one-table loop.
  Two things had to be exact. First, ORT must fuse the batched graph the
  way it fuses the B=1 one: with a symbolic batch axis a 3-D activation
  stays MatMul-then-Add (a different rounding of the bias, ~1e-6 in the
  logits) while the B=1 graph gets MatMul+Add→Gemm through constant-shape
  Reshapes, and a fully 2-D module loses the Add+LayerNorm→
  SkipLayerNormalization fusion instead. The module therefore runs each
  linear on an explicit 2-D view and keeps the residual stream 3-D — the
  optimized graph then has the published one's kernel mix (49 Gemm, 18
  SkipLayerNorm, 12 FusedMatMul), and B=1 reproduces the published
  `decoder_kv.onnx` **bit for bit** over 3 random tables × 48 greedy steps.
  Second, the script's batching gate asserts that two tables decoded in one
  batch give, step by step, the logits and hidden states each gives alone
  (row b of an `[B,K]·[K,N]` GEMM is the `[1,K]` result in MLAS).
- **The loop** (`tableformer.rs::decode_batch`): every table of a page is
  encoded, the per-layer cross tensors are stacked along the batch axis
  (one ~20 MB copy per table per page), and one loop steps all of them. The
  caches start at `past=0` for every row and grow in lockstep, so nothing
  is padded or masked; a table that emits `<end>` keeps its row (fed `END`,
  output ignored) until the last one finishes, and each table then runs its
  own bbox head. Detected from the decoder's `tag` input having a symbolic
  batch axis, so the older fixed-`[1,1]` export keeps decoding one table at
  a time; a page with one table takes exactly that path; a failing batched
  run falls back to it.
- **What it buys, and what it can't.** Per-op profile of one step (1
  thread, past=50): the 49 Gemm total **6.8 ms at B=1 and 6.8 ms at B=2** —
  the weights do stream once for all rows — but each table brings its own
  cross-attention: q·Kᵀ and softmax·V over 784 image positions × 6 layers
  read ~19 MB of that table's `cross_kt`/`cross_v` per step (FusedMatMul
  1.7 → 3.2 ms, MatMul 1.5 → 2.6 ms for B 1 → 2). So a step costs 10.5 ms
  alone, 13.5 for two tables, 19.6 for four, 34 for eight: **−35% per table
  at two tables per page, −55% at four**, and that is the bound — the
  cross-attention reads are the model's, not the loop's.
- **Measured** (`DOCLING_RS_TIMING=1`, same binary, published vs
  dynamic-batch decoder): `2203.01017v2` (two tables on each of its pages)
  decode loop 3.1 → 2.5 s (297 single steps → 178 shared ones), serial wall
  25.2 → 24.6 s, default pool 10.0 → 9.4 s; `2206.01062` decode 5.6 →
  4.7 s, pool 10.4 → 9.8 s; `redp5110_sampled` (one table per page) flat,
  as it must be. Pool wall moves less than the decode does because the
  deferral machinery of round two already overlaps a page's tables with
  other pages' layout. Output byte-identical to the round-three references
  on the serial path and on a 2-worker pool over the same 32 documents.
- **Memory:** a page's tables are now all held encoded at once (per-layer
  cross tensors ~19 MB each) plus their stacked copy, against which the
  hoisted decoder's never-read stacked `cross_k`/`cross_v` (2×9.6 MB per
  table) are dropped at encode time now instead of living for the table's
  lifetime. Net on `2203.01017v2` (default pool): peak RSS 1.74 → 1.81 GB.

The dynamic-batch `decoder_kv.onnx` reaches users through the models
release (`publish-models.yml` re-run); until then the shipped decoder simply
takes the one-table-at-a-time path.

#### Round five (Sep 2026): the page→1024 resample, and a cache that cannot be poisoned

Two small items left over from round four's profile of master.

- **`inter_area`** (the page → 1024 px `cv2.INTER_AREA` box filter every
  table crop is cut from; `tableformer.inter_area`, ~0.16 s per table page
  in the pool, 43 ms in isolation) kept its addition order — horizontal
  taps in increasing source column, then vertical taps in increasing source
  row, f64 — and changed only its shape: the shrunk source rows are now
  computed on demand as the vertical pass reaches them and kept in a ring
  of a few rows (a source row feeds at most two output rows) instead of a
  30 MB `sh × dw` intermediate written and re-read, the horizontal taps run
  over the contiguous byte span they cover, and the vertical pass is a flat
  `f64` axpy. **43 → 18 ms** per page render (1224×1584 → 791×1024, one
  thread); a test asserts the bytes equal the naive per-pixel form on six
  geometries, and the 32-document corpus is byte-identical on the serial
  path and the 2-worker pool.
- **Graph cache guard** (`docling_onnx::commit`). ONNX Runtime serializes
  the optimized graph as a side effect of session creation and does not
  fail the session when that write comes up short: a full disk truncates
  the file and the session still initializes from memory. The cache then
  published the prefix, and every later process tried it, failed, removed
  it and rebuilt — a ~50 s cold start for the TableFormer graphs, seen once
  right after a disk-full episode in the round-four session. The commit
  path now checks the file's protobuf skeleton before renaming it into the
  cache (each top-level field's declared length must end within the file;
  a truncation lands inside the multi-megabyte `graph` field), a handful of
  reads and seeks, never a parse of the weights.

#### TableFormer decoder: dynamic INT8 (~10% faster tables, byte-identical)

The autoregressive tag decoder is MatMul-only; weights-only dynamic INT8
produced **byte-identical corpus output** and ~10% faster table decode
(784 → 695 ms/table), 78 → 50 MB. Small but free.

The decoder speed is *not* weight-bound — it is per-step overhead (see backlog
item 2), which is why quantization helps so little there.

### GPU execution providers (#74) — validated on GPU (#108)

The ONNX sessions (layout, TableFormer×3, OCR recognition, both enrichment
models) accept alternative ONNX Runtime execution providers behind cargo
features: `cuda`, `tensorrt`, `directml` (Windows), `coreml` (macOS). CPU
stays the default in every configuration — the features only compile a
provider in; `DOCLING_RS_EP` selects one at runtime:

| `DOCLING_RS_EP` | behavior |
|---|---|
| unset | `auto` in a build with any GPU feature compiled in (a GPU build should use the GPU); CPU in a default build |
| `cpu` | CPU, byte-for-byte the pre-#74 code path (no EP registered) |
| `cuda` \| `tensorrt` \| `directml` \| `coreml` | that provider, **error-on-failure**: an explicitly requested accelerator that can't initialize fails the conversion instead of silently degrading to a 10×-slower CPU run; requesting one that isn't compiled in warns once and stays on CPU |
| `auto` | every compiled-in provider registered in order TensorRT → CUDA → CoreML → DirectML; ONNX Runtime falls back down the list to CPU at session creation (for images deployed on mixed fleets) |

When a GPU provider is selected the model resolution skips the int8 defaults
in favor of fp32 (`decoder_kv.onnx` stays preferred): the int8 exports are
QDQ graphs calibrated for CPU kernels — on GPU they add de-quantize traffic
and their conformance was only ever validated on CPU. An explicit
`DOCLING_*_ONNX` path override still wins over this policy.

Verified without GPU hardware (this is what CI's `ep-features` matrix
covers): default/`cpu`/`auto`/unknown/uncompiled-request configurations all
produce byte-identical corpus output on a CPU-only build; on a
`--features cuda` build with no usable CUDA, `auto` falls back to CPU with
fp32 models selected (output byte-identical to `DOCLING_RS_FP32=1`) and
`DOCLING_RS_EP=cuda` fails loudly at the first session load. In CLI batch
mode (`--input`/`--output`) that first failure aborts the whole batch —
every remaining PDF would fail identically, so they are reported as
`skipped` instead of producing one error line per file.

#### Measured on real hardware (issue #108)

`scripts/test/gpu_benchmark.sh` — every corpus PDF (+ the scanned set)
under `cpu` and `cuda`, best of 3 cold CLI runs each, outputs
byte-compared. Machine: **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Laptop (16 GB), driver
566.07 · AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX, 16 logical cores** (both providers on the
fp32 models, per the policy above).

**Output equivalence:** 21 of 22 fixtures byte-identical to CPU; one
(`2203.01017v2`, the heaviest layout) differs by 2 markdown lines — fp32
CUDA kernels are not bit-identical to fp32 CPU kernels, so a borderline
detection can flip; groundtruth-distance parity is the standard here, and
byte-parity on 21/22 exceeds it. The entire 2-line diff is one label flip
on one borderline region: the caption fragment
`c. Structure predicted by TableFormer:` comes out as a `list_item`
(`- c. …`) on CPU and as plain `text` on CUDA — same content, same
position, one class score straddling the 0.3 threshold.

**Corpus total (best-of-3): CPU 124.5 s · CUDA 101.2 s → 1.23×** — but the
aggregate hides a clean size split:

| segment | speedup (best) |
|---|---|
| multi-page digital (9–39 pages: arXiv papers, redp5110) | **1.5–2.1×** (`2305.03393v1`: 13.6 s → 7.0 s) |
| mid-size digital (4–5 pages) | 1.1–1.3× |
| 1–2-page digital | 0.75–1.0× — CUDA EP init + host↔device traffic never amortizes |
| scanned/OCR-heavy | 0.65–0.85× — dominated by pdfium render + OCR pre/post on CPU |

The corpus is small-document-biased; on a genuinely large document the
init noise vanishes and the ONNX stages dominate — that is the regime the
GPU features exist for. The 1913-page .NET C# language reference (same
machine, single cold run each):

| provider | wall time | speedup |
|---|---|---|
| `cpu` | 15 min 13 s (767 % CPU) | — |
| `cuda` | **1 min 45 s** (321 % CPU) | **8.7×** |

Practical guidance: the break-even for a cold CLI run sits around 3–4
pages. Below that, or for OCR-heavy scans, stay on CPU; for batches or
services use the warm `Pipeline` / `docling-serve`, which pays EP
initialization once per process instead of once per file and moves the
break-even to roughly "any document with a table". The cold-vs-best gap on
the CUDA column (~1.5–2.5 s) is that per-process EP initialization made
visible. (Timing methodology: the script reads the monotonic clock —
wall-clock `date` proved able to step backwards under NTP mid-benchmark.)

### Ranked backlog of further ideas

Ordered by expected impact ÷ risk. Items 1–3 attack the 85–95%.

1. ~~**Ship/document the INT8 layout model as the default CPU
   configuration**~~ **Done on this branch:** the pipeline prefers the int8
   models when present (`DOCLING_RS_FP32=1` opts out),
   `download_dependencies.sh` fetches them by default, and
   `publish-models.yml` builds them. Biggest single validated win: ~1.4–2×
   end-to-end.
2. **TableFormer decode-loop overhead** (~800 ms/table, ~60–500 steps):
   - ~~`decode_step` copies the whole KV cache out (`ocache.to_vec()`) and back
     in every step — O(steps²·6·512) float traffic.~~ **Done on this branch:**
     the cache and the encoder's cross-K/V + `enc_out` stay owned `ort` values
     fed straight back into the next run (~9% faster structure decode,
     byte-identical output).
   - ~~The exported graph still re-embeds the **full tag sequence** every
     step.~~ **Built and measured:** `scripts/install/export_tableformer.py` now also
     exports `decoder_kv.onnx`, a true-KV-cache step (one tag in, projected
     K/V cached per layer), verified argmax-identical over a 64-step rollout
     and byte-identical on corpus output. Measured result: **parity** with
     the legacy graph on corpus-sized tables (~100–300 tokens) — ONNX Runtime
     executes the legacy graph's full-prefix re-projection as one efficient
     batched GEMM, so the O(n²) FLOPs don't become O(n²) wall time until
     tables get much larger. The Rust loop auto-detects the graph generation
     (input names) and prefers `decoder_kv(_int8).onnx` by default; point
     `DOCLING_TABLEFORMER_DECODER` at the legacy `decoder(_int8).onnx` to
     trade speed back for the smaller file. **#97** rebuilt the KV step
     graph around hoisted cross-attention: the stacked `cross_k`/`cross_v`
     inputs made every decode step re-`Split` and re-`Transpose` 2×9.6 MB of
     constants (~5 ms of a ~7.5 ms step, measured with the ORT node
     profiler); the encoder now emits each layer's `cross_kt_i` (pre-transposed
     for q·Kᵀ) and `cross_v_i` once per table and the step graph consumes
     them in place. Per-step decode fell 17 → 10 ms and `tableformer.structure`
     1.40 → 0.91 s on the huge-table page (2305.03393v1-pg9, fp32); the
     remaining step cost is real compute (28 small projection/FFN GEMMs).
     Output stays byte-identical (the full snapshot corpus, 94 outputs; the export
     self-verifies a 64-step argmax-identical rollout vs the legacy graph).
     Export subtlety: the example inputs must carry `past>0` or
     `torch.export` specializes `pe[cache.shape[3]]` to `pe[0]` and decode
     never terminates. Old stacked-KV and legacy graphs keep working (three
     generations auto-detected); a hoisted decoder with a pre-#97 encoder
     falls back to geometric tables with a re-export hint.
3. ~~**Layout batching for the parallel path**: the pool currently runs batch-1
   inference per page.~~ **Done (issue #73)**: each pool worker drains the work
   channel opportunistically (whatever is already rendered, up to
   `DOCLING_RS_PDF_LAYOUT_BATCH` — default per-page on CPU, 4 on GPU, #338) and
   layout-detects the batch with one inference call — batching never *waits* for pages, so it adds no
   latency when rendering is the bottleneck. Needs the dynamic-batch ONNX
   export (`scripts/install/export_layout.py`); an old fixed-batch graph
   triggers a warn-once per-page fallback. Two export subtleties keep numerics
   identical to the historical static export: a plain `dynamic_axes` export
   leaves the AIFI sincos position embedding as runtime ops that drift ~1e-6
   from the torch-folded constant (enough to flip borderline detections
   corpus-wide — groundtruth exact matches dropped 5/14 → 0/14 before the
   fix), so the exporter folds the static graph's position-embedding subgraph
   offline and splices the constant into the dynamic graph. Verified at the
   time: groundtruth parity restored (then 5/14 exact, 6/14 normalized), and
   batch=1 == batch=4 **bit-identical** across the whole corpus.
4. **The 3×→2× page downscale** (~15% of a text-heavy conversion, ~25% after
   INT8): ~~replace the scalar `image`-crate CatmullRom with a SIMD
   convolution.~~ **Done on this branch:** `fast_image_resize` with the same
   a=-0.5 Catmull-Rom kernel — `image.resize` drops **2607 → 152 ms (17×)**
   on the 16-page doc. The SIMD fixed-point path differs from the scalar one
   by ±1/255 on some pixels, which can flip borderline table cells, so it was
   gated like INT8: groundtruth distance over the corpus is **817 (SIMD) vs
   818 (scalar)** — conformance-neutral. `DOCLING_RS_SLOW_RESIZE=1` restores
   the scalar path, and `pdf_conformance.sh`/`pdf_groundtruth.sh` pin it so
   the committed snapshot baselines stay valid. (The render-side `as_image()`
   copy turned out to be a non-issue: pdfium already renders with reversed
   byte order, so it is one memcpy + one 4→3-channel pass, ~1% of total.)
5. **textparse font caching** (marginal for PDFs — textparse is ≤1% — but
   real for `no_ocr` mode where it becomes the bottleneck):
   - ~~fonts are fully re-parsed for **every page** and every Form-XObject
     invocation; decoded form content re-inflated per `Do`.~~ **Done on this
     branch:** per-document caches keyed by object id (fonts also by resource
     name, which feeds the docling-parse font hash). Identical output across
     the corpus; 3–10% off the `textparse` stage on the test fixtures (their
     ToUnicode CMaps are small — CJK/form-heavy documents benefit far more).
   - ~~`line_cells` + `word_cells` re-built the char cells twice per page.~~
     **Done** (`dp_lines::line_and_word_cells`): the glyph build is shared;
     the line and word views each run their own contraction (docling-parse's
     `create_line_cells` / `create_word_cells` pair — deliberately two
     passes, since the factors differ).
   - `decode_code`/`decompose_ligatures` allocate a `String` per glyph
     (`textparse.rs`); decompose once at font-parse time and return
     borrowed `&str`.
   - RTL merge is O(n²) (string prepend in `merge_with`, `dp_lines.rs`);
     accumulate reversed and flip once per line.
6. ~~**OCR line batching** (`ocr.rs::recognize`): lines are recognized one at
   a time on one thread (deliberately, for CTC determinism). Batching
   same-width buckets keeps determinism per line.~~ **Done on this branch**
   (`ocr.rs::recognize_batch`): each page's line crops are gathered first and
   equal-width lines share one recognition run (page order, batches capped at
   16). Same-width batching is **bit-identical** to sequential runs (verified:
   max output diff 0.0 over the scanned corpus's crops); the snapshot corpus
   is unchanged. Measured `ocr.page`: 195 → 176 ms on `ocr_test.pdf`, 682 →
   587 ms over `nemotron_multipage.pdf`'s 4 pages (−10–14%). The
   "several-fold" hope required *padded* batches (PaddleOCR-style, pad to
   bucket max): measured on the real crops, padding perturbs the valid
   region's probabilities by up to 0.34 through the model's global-attention
   blocks and changes the decoded text on 16/20 lines — off the table for a
   byte-stable pipeline. The remaining lever is running same-width buckets
   across the page-worker pool's idle threads (needs one extra session per
   worker: `ort`'s `Session::run` takes `&mut self`).
7. **ort session options**: checked — ONNX Runtime's C-API default is already
   `ORT_ENABLE_ALL`, so an explicit optimization level gains nothing.
   `with_optimized_model_path` (caching the optimized graph on disk) could
   still shave per-worker model-load latency; only worth it if pool spin-up
   shows up in a real deployment.

### Memory

Each pool worker used to own a full model set, so peak RSS scaled with the
pool: on a 4-worker machine ~0.4 GB of TableFormer weights+arenas were
duplicated four times even though tables appear on a minority of pages. The
pool now shares **one lazily-loaded TableFormer** behind a mutex (loaded with
the full intra-op budget, since tables serialise on it anyway; prediction is
independent of which worker runs it). Measured on the 16-page table-heavy
paper, INT8 stack:

| pool | per-worker TF (before) | shared TF (after) |
|---|---:|---:|
| 4 workers | 3816 MB | **1880 MB** |
| 2 workers | 2183 MB | **1517 MB** |
| 4 workers, table-free doc | 682 MB | **331 MB** (TableFormer never loads) |

`DOCLING_RS_PDF_WORKERS` remains the coarse memory knob on top.

### Determinism note (pre-existing, worth knowing)

Multi-threaded ONNX Runtime float reductions are **not deterministic
run-to-run**: on `2203.01017v2.pdf` two identical invocations of the same
binary can differ in a handful of borderline table cells (measured 0–20
Markdown diff-lines between repeat runs, before any of this branch's
changes). `ocr.rs` already pins its session to one thread for exactly this
reason. Regression checks for structural changes should therefore compare
outputs under `DOCLING_RS_PDF_THREADS=1` (single-thread inference is
deterministic and byte-stable); multi-threaded corpus diffs of a few lines on
table-dense fixtures are thread-scheduling jitter, not necessarily a real
change.

### Correctness notes found during review (quality, not speed)

- `textparse.rs` `"` operator: the `aw ac string "` form must set word/char
  spacing (`tw`/`tc`) from its first two operands before showing the string;
  they are currently ignored (`Tj | ' | "` share one arm), so documents using
  `"` get wrong inter-word advances. **Fixed in this branch.**
- `textparse.rs::page_size` ignores a non-zero MediaBox origin; a page with
  e.g. `[9 9 621 801]` offsets all parser cells relative to pdfium's raster.
  Rare, but cheap to guard: subtract the box origin when emitting glyph boxes.
- OCR recognition ran un-instrumented; `ocr.page` is now a timed stage (this
  branch), so scanned-corpus profiles attribute it correctly.

### Reproducing

```bash
scripts/install/download_dependencies.sh
cargo build --release

# stage timing
DOCLING_RS_TIMING=1 ./target/release/docling-rs input.pdf > /dev/null

# build the int8 models (used automatically once present)
uv venv .venv-quant && uv pip install --python .venv-quant/bin/python \
    onnx onnxruntime sympy pypdfium2 pillow numpy
.venv-quant/bin/python scripts/install/quantize_models.py

# force full precision for a run
DOCLING_RS_FP32=1 ./target/release/docling-rs input.pdf > /dev/null
```

Integration points: `scripts/install/download_dependencies.sh` fetches the
pre-quantized assets by default (`--no-int8` skips; published by
`.github/workflows/publish-models.yml`, which quantizes after export);
`scripts/install/pdf_setup.sh` quantizes locally unless `DOCLING_RS_FP32=1`;
`scripts/test/performance.sh` benchmarks whatever the pipeline default resolves to
(int8 when present, `DOCLING_RS_FP32=1` for fp32); `examples/Dockerfile`
bakes both precisions and defaults to int8 (`--build-arg INT8=0` for fp32).
